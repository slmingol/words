## Original Blog Post on Words
People that know me know that from time to time I will mention that there are words that really bug the crap out of me. I don’t know why but I can remember as far back as 7-8th grade dying laughing when I first heard the word plush. The same applies to words that I can’t stand, like the word slacks. So what I’m going to do is create this post as my catch-all for my word lists. I will update it everytime I encounter/re-encounter one of these dreaded … WORDS!

Here are my lists!
